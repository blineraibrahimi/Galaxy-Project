						<h1>EARTH</h1>
						<p>
							Earth is the planet we live on. It is the third planet from the Sun. It is the only planet known to have life on it.
							The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. 
							The other three are Mercury, Venus and Mars. The large mass of the Sun makes Earth move around it, just as the mass of Earth 
							makes the moon move around it. Earth also turns around in space, so that different parts face the Sun at different times.
							Earth goes around the Sun once (one "year") for every 365¼ times it turns around (one "day").
							Earth is the only planet in our solar system that has a large amount of liquid water. 
							About 74% of the surface of Earth is covered by liquid or frozen water. Because of this,
							people sometimes call it "blue planet".

						<h1>MOON</h1>
						<p>Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot. The brightest and largest object in our night sky, 
						the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet. It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. 
						Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei
						discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. We only see one side of the Moon all the time. Human's didn't see the lunar
						far side until a Soviet spaecraft flew past in 1959. The Moon has no moons. More than 105 robotic spacecraft have been launched
						to explore the Moon. It is the only celestial body beyond Earth—so far—visited by human beings. </p>

						<h1>SUN</h1>
						<p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
					Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. The Sun is roughly middle-aged; 
					it has not changed dramatically for more than four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five
					billion years. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest
					particles of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the Sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the 
					solar system by the solar wind—a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions.</p>

						<p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than
						Earth's Moon. One day on Mercury takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. 
						Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days. Mercury has 
						a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon. Mercury has no moons. There are no rings around Mercury.</p>

						<h1>VENUS</h1>
						<p>Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor, Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, 
						but it is now a very different world. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the
						hottest planet in our solar system. One day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days because Venus spins backwards, with 
						its sun rising in the west and setting in the east. Venus has no moons and no rings. Many scientists believe water
						once existed on the surface. Future Venus explorers will search for evidence of an ancient ocean</p>

						planet has seasons, polar ice caps and weather and canyons, evidence of an even more active past.Mars is one of
						the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien
						landscape. NASA currently has three spacecraft in orbit, one rover and one lander on the surface and another rover
						under construction here on Earth. India and ESA also have spacecraft in orbit above Mars.One day on Mars takes
						a little over 24 hours. Mars makes a complete orbit around the Sun in 687 Earth days. Mars has two moons named
						Phobos and Deimos. There are no rings around Mars.</p>

						<h1>JUPITER</h1>
						<p>Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the 
						first moons beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. Fifth in line from the Sun, 
						Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. 
						Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water. One spacecraft — NASA's Juno
						orbiter — is currently exploring this giant world. Jupiter rotates once about every 10 hours, but takes 
						about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit of the Sun. Jupiter has more than 75 moons. In 1979 the Voyager mission 
						discovered Jupiter’s faint ring system. All four giant planets in our solar system have ring systems.</p>

						<h1>SATURN</h1>
						<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest planet in our solar system. Adorned with thousands 
						of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings—made of chunks of 
						ice and rock—but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Nine Earths side by side would almost span
						Saturn’s diameter. That doesn’t include Saturn’s rings. Saturn takes about 10.7 hours (no one knows precisely)
						to rotate on its axis once—a Saturn “day”—and 29 Earth years to orbit the sun. Saturn has 53 known moons with an
						additional nine moons awaiting confirmation of their discovery—that is a total of 62 moons.Saturn has the most
						spectacular ring system, with seven rings and several gaps and divisions between them.</p>

						<h1>URANUS</h1>
						<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel,
						although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was
						universally accepted as a new planet. Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, 
						Uranus would be the size of a basketball. Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once, and about 84 Earth years 
						to complete an orbit of the Sun. Uranus has 27 known moons, and they are named after characters from the works 
						of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus has 13 known rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark and 
						the outer rings are brightly colored. Like Venus, Uranus rotates east to west.</p>

						<h1>NEPTUNE</h1>
						<p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar
						system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible 
						to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846. NASA's Voyager 2
						is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.
						Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once, and about 165 Earth years to orbit the sun. Neptune has 13 moons 
						(and one more awaiting confirmation of discovery), which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. 
						Neptune has six known rings.</p>

						<h1>PLUTO</h1>
						<p>Pluto is smaller than Earth’s Moon has a heart-shaped glacier that’s the size of Texas and Oklahoma.
						This fascinating world has blue skies, spinning moons, mountains as high as the Rockies, and it snows—but the
						snow is red. A year on Pluto is 248 Earth years. A day on Pluto lasts 153 hours, or about 6 Earth days.
						Pluto is officially classified as a dwarf planet. Pluto has 5 moons. The largest, Charon, is so big that Pluto
						and Charon orbit each other like a double planet. Pluto has no ring system. Pluto is the only world (so far)
						named by an 11-year-old girl. In 1930, Venetia Burney of Oxford, England, suggested to her grandfather that the
						new discovery be named Pluto.</p>
